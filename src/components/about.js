    <p>At Lotus Valley International School, Gurugram, we aspire to craft socially conscious, self-aware and responsible global citizens who will construct, shape, and serve society. The school proposes to create a system that is aligned with the aspirational goals of state-of-the-art education, including SDG4 while building upon Indiaâ€™s traditions and value systems. The school lays particular emphasis on the development of the creative potential of each individual based on the principle that education must develop not only cognitive capacities but also social, ethical, and emotional dimensions and dispositions.</p>
